# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail<-read.csv(file = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv', sep = '\t', header = TRUE )
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
clean_df<-separate_rows(cocktail,ingredients,sep="<br/>")
clean_df$ingredients=sub("(.* (oz( of)?|(dash(es)?)|(drop(s)?)|(bsp))) ","",clean_df$ingredients)
clean_df$ingredients=gsub(" \\(.* abv\\).*","",clean_df$ingredients)
clean_df

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
sort(unique(clean_df$ingredients))
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
length(unique(clean_df$ingredients))
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
rev(tail(names(sort(table(clean_df$ingredients))), 10))
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
(table(clean_df$name))[table(clean_df$name)==(tail(sort(table(clean_df$name)), 1))[1]]

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
length(table(clean_df$ingredients)[table(clean_df$ingredients)==1])
length(table(clean_df$name)[table(clean_df$name)==1])
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
ingredient_frequency = table(clean_df$ingredients)
rare_ingredients=ingredient_frequency[ingredient_frequency==1]
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients=filter(clean_df, ingredients %in% names(rare_ingredients))
unique(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients$name)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktail_names_with_rare_ingredients=unique(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients$name)
cocktail_names_with_rare_ingredients
cocktails_with_common_ingredients=filter(clean_df,!name %in% cocktail_names_with_rare_ingredients  )
unique(cocktails_with_common_ingredients$name)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
unique_ingredients=unique(clean_df$ingredients)
unique_names=unique(clean_df$name)

rv <- vector()

for (i in unique_ingredients) {
    for (n in unique_names) {
        if (nrow(filter(clean_df, name==n & ingredients==i)) >0) {
        rv=c(rv,'x')
        } else {
        rv=c(rv,'')
        }
    }
}


frequency_table <- matrix(
    rv,
    ncol = length(unique_ingredients),
    nrow = length(unique(unique_names)),
    dimnames = list(unique(unique_names), unique(unique_ingredients))
)
frequency_table
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
