# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andr3ahor/r_data_analysis_2122_fall/master/data/cocktail_data.tsv', header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# I couldn't handle ' and # charachters, therefore I deleted them manually from the original file.
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#Tidyr package install és load.
library(tidyr)

#Separate rows for ingredients, along <br/> 
cocktail_data <- separate_rows(cocktail_data, ingredients, sep = "<br/>", convert = FALSE)

#and with <br> 
cocktail_data <- separate_rows(cocktail_data, ingredients, sep = "<br>", convert = FALSE) 

#I checked the column names
colnames(cocktail_data, do.NULL =FALSE)

#I elimited from ingredients column the 'oz''dash/es''drop/s' and 'bps' 
cocktail_data <- data.frame(lapply(cocktail_data, function(x) {gsub(".*oz ", "", x)}))
cocktail_data <- data.frame(lapply(cocktail_data, function(x) {gsub(".*drop ", "", x)}))
cocktail_data <- data.frame(lapply(cocktail_data, function(x) {gsub(".*drops ", "", x)}))
cocktail_data <- data.frame(lapply(cocktail_data, function(x) {gsub(".*dash ", "", x)}))
cocktail_data <- data.frame(lapply(cocktail_data, function(x) {gsub(".*dashes ", "", x)}))
cocktail_data <- data.frame(lapply(cocktail_data, function(x) {gsub(".*bsp ", "", x)}))

#I deleted () as well
library(stringr)
cocktail_data$ingredients <- str_remove(cocktail_data$ingredients, pattern = "\\(.*")
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
#Cleaning data: I had to separate rows in ingredients along 'or' 
cocktail_data <- separate_rows(cocktail_data, ingredients, sep = "or", convert = FALSE)

#Cleanin data: deleting dashes from the start and of the ends of rows 
cocktail_data$ingredients <- trimws(cocktail_data$ingredients, which = c("both"))

#Unique, not empty data
cocktailunique <- unique(cocktail_data$ingredients[cocktail_data$ingredients != ""])

#ABC sorting
sorted_ingr <- sort(cocktailunique)


```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#Summary of sorted_ingr variable = 60
summary(sorted_ingr)

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
#The 10 most frequent ingredients. I asked for more as there were a lot of ties.
top10 <- sort(table(cocktail_data$ingredients), decreasing = TRUE) [1:25]
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
#As 1 coctail has multiple rows, I checked which coctail name is the most frequent. I found 6 equally frequent name, these have the most ingredients.
complex_cocktails <- sort(table(cocktail_data$name), decreasing = TRUE) [1:6]
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
#There are 25 rare ingredient 
rare_ingr <- sort(table(cocktail_data$ingredients), increasing = TRUE) [1:28]
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare_cocktail <- cocktail_data %>% filter(ingredients == "absinthe"|ingredients =="Absolut Citron vodka" |ingredients =="agar-clarified grapefruit juice" |ingredients =="Amer Picon" |ingredients =="centrifuge-clarified grapefruit juice" |ingredients == "Cherry Herring" |ingredients =="cranberry juice" |ingredients =="crem de violette" |ingredients =="Demerara syrup" |ingredients =="Dolin dry vermouth" |ingredients =="Drambuie" |ingredients =="Fernet Branca" |ingredients =="heavy cream" |ingredients =="Hellfire bitters" |ingredients =="Lairds Applejack Bottled in Bond" |ingredients =="Old Tom gin" |ingredients =="pisco" |ingredients =="quinine simple syrup" |ingredients =="saline" |ingredients =="simple" |ingredients == "sloe gin" |ingredients =="sugard 80-proof rum" |ingredients =="sugared 100-proof rye" |ingredients =="white crÂŹme de cacao" |ingredients =="white mezcal" |ingredients =="ange juice" |ingredients =="apple brandy" |ingredients =="blanco tequila")
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
notrare_cocktail <- cocktail_data %>% filter(ingredients != "absinthe"|ingredients !="Absolut Citron vodka" |ingredients !="agar-clarified grapefruit juice" |ingredients !="Amer Picon" |ingredients !="centrifuge-clarified grapefruit juice" |ingredients != "Cherry Herring" |ingredients !="cranberry juice" |ingredients !="crem de violette" |ingredients !="Demerara syrup" |ingredients !="Dolin dry vermouth" |ingredients !="Drambuie" |ingredients !="Fernet Branca" |ingredients !="heavy cream" |ingredients !="Hellfire bitters" |ingredients !="Lairds Applejack Bottled in Bond" |ingredients !="Old Tom gin" |ingredients !="pisco" |ingredients !="quinine simple syrup" |ingredients !="saline" |ingredients !="simple" |ingredients != "sloe gin" |ingredients !="sugard 80-proof rum" |ingredients !="sugared 100-proof rye" |ingredients !="white crÂŹme de cacao" |ingredients !="white mezcal" |ingredients !="ange juice" |ingredients !="apple brandy" |ingredients !="blanco tequila")

#This is the final coctail name list, without duplications. 
notrare <- unique(notrare_cocktail$name, incomparables = FALSE)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
#Coctails= we need 55 rows
unique(cocktail_data$name)

#Ingredients = we need 61 columns
unique(cocktail_data$ingredients)

#I was not able to find hot to create this table.
```

```{r}

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
