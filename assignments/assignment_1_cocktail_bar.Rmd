# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

*I have added my comments with italic*

*First, I have loaded the packages I am going to need and came back here every time I needed to add something* 
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(splitstackshape) 
library(stringr)
library(rlang)
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
cocktail_bar <- read_tsv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"))
View(cocktail_bar)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

*I have realized the separator, so next I count how much is the most ingredients:*

```{r}
ingredients <- cocktail_bar$ingredients
str_count(ingredients, pattern = "<br/>")
```

*5 is the most, so I am gonna need 6 columns for ingredients:*

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
cocktail_bar_separated <- cocktail_bar %>%
  separate(ingredients,into= c("ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3", "ingredient4", "ingredient5", "ingredient6"), sep= "<br/>")
```

*Cleaning the ingredient1:ingredient6 columns and checking the result*

```{r}
cocktail_bar_cleaned <- cocktail_bar_separated %>% 
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*oz ", '', .))) %>%
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*OZ ", '', .))) %>% 
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*dashes", '', .))) %>%
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*dash", '', .))) %>%
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*drops", '', .))) %>%
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*drop", '', .))) %>%
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~sub(".*bsp", '', .))) %>%
  mutate(across(ingredient1:ingredient6, ~str_replace(., " \\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "")))

View(cocktail_bar_cleaned)
```

*Making it tidy*

```{r}
cocktail_bar_cleaned <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=8:13, names_to = "ingredients", values_drop_na=TRUE)
```

*Making them all lower case*

```{r}
cocktail_bar_cleaned <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  mutate(value = tolower(value))
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

*For this I am working in a list*

*Cleaining the white spaces*

```{r}
ingredients_list<- trimws(cocktail_bar_cleaned$value, which = c("left"), whitespace = "[ \t\r\n]")
```

*Making sure there are only one from each and arranging them*

```{r}
ingredients_list_unique <- unique(ingredients_list)
ingredients_list_unique_arranged <- str_sort(ingredients_list_unique)
```

*Here they are ordered:*

```{r}
ingredients_list_unique_arranged
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

*There are 61.*

```{r}
ingredients_list_unique_arranged_df <- as.data.frame(ingredients_list_unique_arranged)
nrow(ingredients_list_unique_arranged_df)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_ingredients <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
mutate(value = fct_lump_n(value, n=10)) %>%
filter (value != "Other") %>%
  count(value) %>%
  arrange(n)
```

*Here are the top 11 ingredients*

```{r}
top_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_bar_cleaned$name <- as.factor(cocktail_bar_cleaned$name)
most_ingredients <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  mutate(name = fct_lump_n(name, n=1)) %>%
  filter (name != "Other") %>%
  count(name)
```

Here are the cocktails with the most (6) ingredients

```{r}
most_ingredients
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  count(value)

rare_ingredients <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  count(value)%>%
  filter (n == "1")
```

*There are 29 ingredients which only appear in one cocktail.*

```{r}
nrow(rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktails_with_rares <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  mutate(value = fct_lump_n(value, n=-1)) %>%
  filter (value != "Other") %>%
  count(name)
```

*Here they are:*

```{r}
print(cocktails_with_rares$name)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

*These are:*

```{r}
without_rare <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  group_by(value) %>% 
  filter(n() != 1)

without_rare <- unique(without_rare$name)
without_rare
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cocktail_bar_character <- as.character(cocktail_bar_cleaned$value)

cocktail_bar_cheatsheet <- cocktail_bar_cleaned %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = value) 

cocktail_bar_cheatsheet[ , 10:71 ][ cocktail_bar_cheatsheet[ , 10:71 ] != "NA" ] <- "X"

cocktail_bar_cheatsheet[is.na(cocktail_bar_cheatsheet)] <- ""
```

*Here it is*

```{r}
print(cocktail_bar_cheatsheet)
View(cocktail_bar_cheatsheet)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
