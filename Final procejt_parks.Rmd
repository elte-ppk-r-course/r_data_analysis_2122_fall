#####In this report i am going to examine how investment (var. spend_per_resident_points) affect different amenities  (var. amenities_points) in parks. I also examine whether parks are rather dog-friendly (var. dogpark_points) or child-friendly (var. playground_points)

#STEPS:
  #1. Create hypothesis
  #2. Explore data
  #3. Assumption testing
  #4. Hypothesis testing & Visualization
  #5. Conlusion
  
####STEP1: Hypothesis
#####################
H1: Higher amount of investment leads to more amenities.
H2: Parks are rather child-friendly than dog-friendly.

####STEP2: EDA
###########
install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-06-22')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 26)

parks <- tuesdata$parks
View(parks)
head(parks)

#EDA
summary(parks)

#selected variables are going to be used: year, city, spend_per_resident_points, basketball_points, dogpark_points, playground_points, rec_sr_points, restroom_points, splashground_points, amenities_points
df<- select(parks, c(year, city, spend_per_resident_points, dogpark_points, playground_points,  amenities_points))

#plot: amenities by year
df %>%
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = amenities_points)) +
      geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
      labs(title = "Amenities in parks by years",
           y = "Amenities (points 0-100)",
           x = "Date") + theme_bw(base_size = 11)
# -------›as the graph of amenities shows, amenities are measured since 2015, therefor years 2012-2014 can be deleted
df<- df %>% as.data.frame(filter_at(vars(1), any_vars(. > 2014)))


#plot: dog-parks by year
df %>%
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = dogpark_points)) +
      geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
      labs(title = "Dog-parks by year",
           y = "Dog parks (points 0-100)",
           x = "Date") + theme_bw(base_size = 11)
#plot: playgrounds by year         
df %>%
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = playground_points)) +
      geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
      labs(title = "Playgrounds by year",
           y = "Plyagrounds (points 0-100)",
           x = "Date") + theme_bw(base_size = 11)
           

##-------› by looking at the graphs it seems like there is no significant difference between dog-parks and playgrounds, testing H2 will give the final answear.

####STEP3: Assumption-check
#######################

#H1 will be tested by linear regression, I start with checking normalities
lm<- lm(df$spend_per_resident_points ~ df$amenities_points)
hist(lm$resid, main="Histogram of Residuals",
 ylab="Residuals")
 
shapiro.test(lm$resid)

##-------› residuals ara not normally distributed. I stop checking other assumptions, linear regression cannot be performed. Later I use simple correlation instead. After checking normality, Spearmant-correlation will be used
shapiro.test(df$dogpark_points)
shapiro.test(df$spend_per_resident_points)

#H2 will be tested by t-test, I start with checking normalities
shapiro.test(df$playground_points)
shapiro.test(df$spend_per_resident_points)

##-------› data is not normal, still I go with t-test, because it is robust to non-normality 

####STEP4: testing hypothesis
#H1 by correlation

cor<- rcorr(cbind(df$spend_per_resident_points, df$amenities_points), type="spearman")
cor

#plotting H1

plot(df$spend_per_resident_points ~ df$amenities_points, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "darkblue", main = "Amenities plotted against investment")
abline(lm(df$spend_per_resident_points ~ df$amenities_points))
         
##-------› correlation gives a significant result, there is moderate positive linear relationship between the two variables.  Higher investment comes with higher points of amenities. p<0,05, r=0,62


#H2: by paired t-test
t.test(df$dogpark_points, df$playground_points, paired = TRUE, alternative = "less")


#plotting H2          

p1 <-ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = dogpark_points)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun="mean", fill = "darkblue") +
      labs(title = "Dog-parks by year",
           y = "Dog parks (points 0-100)",
           x = "Year")

p2 <-ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = playground_points)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun="mean", fill = "darkblue") +
      labs(title = "Playgrounds by year",
           y = "Playgrounds (points 0-100)",
           x = "Year")
           
p1+p2

##-------› t-test confirmed what the earlier graph shew: there isn't any significal difference between the amount of dog-parks and the amount of playgrounds. P>0,05

#STEP5: results
#H1: Higher amount of investment leads to more amenities. ----› linear regression could not be performed, although correlation gives significant result: Higher investment comes with higher points of amenities. However it does not mean that investment affect the amount of amenities, it is only a orrelation, not causation. We cannot reject nor support this hypothesis.

#H2: Parks are rather child-friendly than dog-friendly.----› according to t-test, there is no difference between the amount of dog-friendliness and child-friedliness, we need to reject H2.
